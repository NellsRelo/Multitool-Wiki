# Installation

## Downloading the Latest Version
First thing's first: Before using the Multitool, we need to install it. This process is, thankfully, very simple. You can [follow this link](https://github.com/ShinyHobo/BG3-Modders-Multitool/releases/latest), or follow the below steps:

1. Navigate to the GitHub page for the Multitool, and look for the Releases section:

2. Click on the entry under "Releases" that's marked "Latest." At the time of writing, this will display as "Memory Optimized Models and...", however this will change, as new releases happen frequently. Clicking on the entry will take you to the Release Page, which will show when the release was made, what it's tagged with, and a list of features and fixes.

3. Scroll to the bottom of the page to see the list of Assets associated with the release.

4. Click on `bg3-modders-multitool.zip`

## Installing the Multitool
Now we have the Multitool downloaded to our computer. But we need to be able to use it.

1. Navigate to the location you downloaded the Multitool `.zip` file into, and open it.
2. Open another file manager window and navigate to a folder where you intend on keeping your Mods and Modding tools.
3. Create a folder titled "Multitool."
4. Drag and drop the contents of the Multitool `.zip` file into your newly created folder.

It's that easy - no install programs to wait for. As soon are the files are in your Mutltitool directory, the Multitool is ready to use.
