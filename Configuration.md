# Configuration
Now that we've installed the Multitool, we just have one more step to get it running.

## Opening the Multitool

Once you've installed the Multitool, open the application by double-clicking on the file `bg3-modders-multitool.exe`. You'll be greeted with the window you see on the right:

Welcome to the Multitool. On the left, you can see a large blue area, where you can drag and drop .pak files or your Mod Workspace onto in order to unpack or package, respectivley. To the right, there's also a UUID and TranslatedString Handle Generator, a button to quickly Launch the game, and buttons that allow you to unpack  .pak files, Decompress Files, and Perform an Index Search. At the bottom is a large console space, which will display information as the Multitool performs certain actions. In the menu-bar, we have Utilities, Shortcuts, Help, and Configuration.

Speaking of Configuration, did you notice that text above the console space, `Configuration needed: missing bg3.exe`? Let's solve that problem before going forward.

# Configuring the Multitool

This is the Multitool. You'll need to do a little bit of configuration before you're ready to get started, so let's walk through it.

1. In the Menubar, click "Configuration."
2. Enter the installation directory of your Baldur's Gate 3 game, specifically the location of the file `bg3.exe`. Either Paste it in, or use the `Select` button and navigate to your game's `.exe`.

Once you've done this, the second input field should auto-fill. You're effectivley ready to go, but first we'll go over the remaining options in the Configuration window:

***Language Selection:*** At the time of writing, language options are limited to Chinese and English.

***Quick Launch:*** Ticking this Checkbox will cause the `Launch Game` button on the main window to take you to your most recent save automatically.

***Unlock Threads:*** Ticking this Checkbox will allow the Multitool to use as many CPU threads as possible. Intensive operations, like unpacking the game files, will give you extreme lag when using this, and chances are you won't see any performance benefit from ticking it.
