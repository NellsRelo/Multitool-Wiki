#  GameObject Explorer
The GameObject Explorer, or GOE for short, is a useful tool that allows for quickly searching through Game Objects and their properties, as well as viewing thier models. GameObjects include Characters, Items, and more. It serves a different purpose than the index search, and both are valuable tools for any modder. To access the GameObject Explorer, in the Menubar, go to `Utilities -> GameObject Explorer -> Open`. This will open a new window:

As you can see, there's a lot of ground to cover. On the left, we have a GameObject Type Selector, a Searchbase and Results tree, as well as an info-section on some properties of the file - Where the Pak is located, what it's name is, its Identifier (MapKey), etc. On the right, we have more info: Stats, Attributes, Icon, 3D Model, and any Model Files associated with it.

If you click on the dropdown and select a GameObject type, the Results tree on the left will fill up with unpacked objects of that type. As you navigate through these sections, clicking on the `(+)` next to an entry will open it up in the Right pane. You can filter your results with the Search bar, and easily see everything to do with the selected object.
