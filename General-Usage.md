# General Useage
With the Multitool installed and configured, our Window should look like this:

At this point, let's get into understanding the features of the Multitool.

### Unpacking .pak Files
This is the core feature of the Multitool. It allows you to unpack the game files, and explore how Larian brought Baldur's Gate 3 to life. You'll have plenty of examples on how to create certain aspects of your mod.

### Decompression
When the Multitool has finished Unpacking the game files, there are still files that can't be worked with directly, with extensions like `.lsf`, `.lsb`, or `.loca`. Fortunately, the Multitool can decompress these files into editable `.lsx` and `.xml` files.

### Index and Searching Files
The Multitool provides a handy file search function for its unpacked files, which requires indexing the Unpacked Files to be effective.

### GameObject Explorer
The GameObject Explorer, or GOE for short, is a useful tool that allows for quickly searching through Game Objects and their properties, as well as viewing thier models. It serves a different purpose than the index search, and both are valuable tools for any modder.

### Packaging/Unpackaging Mod Files
One of the more common tasks modders will use the Multitool for is packaging their mods, or unpacking `.pak` files from other mods. Both of these functions work similarly to each other.

### UUID/Handle Generation
If you're creating new Spells, Actions, Statuses, Passives, Races, or Classes, chances are, you're going to need to generate a ton of UUIDs and Localization Handles. Multitool makes this extremely easy, by having a built-in generator in the main window.
